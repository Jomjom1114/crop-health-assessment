# Crop Health Assessment
Crop Health Assessment is a project that aims to help farms and their workers identify whether tomato plant leaves are healthy or diseased, and if they're diseased, specify the type of disease, whether it's tomato early blight or tomato healthy blight.
##A CNN model was developed to assesst the state of the leaves. Then it was deployed by useing Streamlit, and a web app was created.
The farm workers should take a image of the plant leave they want to assesst, upload the image in the web app, then the image will be analyzed by the model and an analysis will be give about its state.
